# OCHN: Open Cloud Host Network - A WIP whitepaper for Distributed Open-Source Cloud Hosting



## 2. Introduction & Background
Open source software and open informaton are a crucial cornerstone of our society. It embeds the idea that knowledge should be open to everybody and builds the foundation of an open internet.
While software and knowledge themselves can be free, we often face dependencies to closed parties for making the Software or Information available. Source code is often hosted on commercial platforms. Websites run on often CDNs. This bears the risk that one entity can influence the roadmap of a project in a utterly imbalanced way. As the avialablity of a service depends on the goodwill of one donor, or community funds, we effectively add more ownership into these hands than necessary.

In other words: the success of free software and knowledge is often dependent on the goodwill of big players.


Free and open ideas should also be free, as in freely reachable, free from dependencies of individual organizations or persons.

### 2.2 Problem Statement
This problem does not only touch the direct dependency of techincal infrastructure, but can be effective in other situations as well. Wikimedia, as a non profit foundation, for example gets critisized for stockpilling [100 millions of US dollars in donations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fundraising_statistics). 

A quote on what [gartner](https://www.technologyreview.com/2013/10/22/175674/the-decline-of-wikipedia/) thinks:
> "Gardner agrees that today’s Web is hostile to self-organized collective efforts, likening it to a city that has lost its public parks. “Our time is spent on an increasingly small number of increasingly large corporate sites,” she says. “We need more public space online.” In fact, Gardner is leaving the foundation at the end of the year in search of new projects to work on that very problem. She contends that even with all its troubles, Wikipedia is one of the Web’s few public parks that won’t disappear."

While they point at the problem that big parts ARE large corporate sites, i claim that open source must be as independent from large corporations as possible.

### 2.3 Vision and Goals
Open ideas and services should be hostet in an open and democratic way. OCHN can enable a crowd sourced cloud hosting for public ideas that matter.
OCHN aims to create open source infrastructure that is:
* distributed and owner-less
* scalable, replicable
* open and free, as in free Beer
* secure
* independent

## 3. OCHN Overview
The open Cloud host network combines the concept from web3 and blockchain with container and cloud technology like kubernetes plus  open source best practices like providing an open repository for streamlining.
It aims to be open infrastructure for hosting free and open ideas and software:
### 3.2 Key Features
* Cloud computing: OHCN represents a cloud architecture built on containers. Projects can be defined in one or more containers, which connect to a open load balancer and provide distributed, global hosting.
* CICD Integration: Containers can be integrated with CICD pipelines, so project updates will be streamlined and any node host will receive updates in a synchronous manner.
* Global load balancing: Each self hosted node is well known by the load balancer and can contribute to a stable service globally
* Self-Hosting the Self-Hosting: OHCN can also host itself and cuts the last hard wires to commercial webhosts.
* Community driven: Through open access and a rule framework, open source projects can contribute their containers to OCHN, given licensing is compatible and quality standards are met. As OHCN is a open source project itself, community rules can be applied accordingly
  
## 4. Technical Concepts
### 4.1 Target Service architecture
OCHN aims to replicate a cloud infrastructure based on openly provided service nodes, providing a public service for publically available information and softare. From the outside, it looks and behaves like any cloud infrastructure.
Internally, the architecture is controlled through configuration, centralized in the code and config of the OCHN service itself.
### 4.2 Container-based Hosting, load Balancing and Software Architecture
Applications can be hosted in containers, as we know them from projets like Docker, Kubernetes and alike.
